  Throughout my career, I have accumulated over ten years of experience in
  programming, with a significant focus on C# and ASP.NET. My journey began with
  mastering the .NET Framework, where I developed a strong foundation in
  object-oriented programming principles. In my role as a Sr. Software Developer
  at Infomeria Pvt. Ltd., I worked extensively with ASP.NET to build dynamic web
  applications. I utilized C# to implement business logic and manage data
  interactions, ensuring that applications were not only functional but also
  efficient and user-friendly. One of my notable projects involved designing and
  developing a Query Management System (QMS), where I leveraged C# and ASP.NET
  to create a three-tier architecture. This project required me to analyze user
  requirements and translate them into technical specifications, which I
  accomplished by developing robust backend services using C# and ASP.NET Web
  API. Additionally, I have experience with ASP.NET Core, which has allowed me
  to build cross-platform applications. My knowledge of Entity Framework further
  enhances my ability to interact with databases effectively, optimizing queries
  and ensuring data integrity. Overall, my experience with C# and ASP.NET has
  equipped me with the skills necessary to develop scalable and maintainable
  applications, aligning perfectly with the requirements of the Technical
  Consultant role.
